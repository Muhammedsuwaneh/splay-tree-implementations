-> Performs various splay tree operations in O(logn) time complexity

-> Splay tree conditions/operations

-> Zig operation
-> Zig-Zig ''

-> Zag-Zig ''
-> Zag-Zag ''
-> Zag ''

-> The splay class has the does the following implementations

-> find(): Finds a tree node based on a given key
-> min(): finds the min node in tree
-> max(): finds the max node in tree
-> add(): adds a new node to tree based on a given key
-> remove(): removes a new node to tree based on a given key
-> print(): prints tree nodes
-> printLevelByLevel(): prints tree nodes on each level
